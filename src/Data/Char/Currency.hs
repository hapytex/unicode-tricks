Module      : Data.Char.Currency
Description : The module exposes a type that defines the different currencies for which there is a Unicode equivalent.
Maintainer  : hapytexeu+gh@gmail.com
Stability   : experimental
Portability : POSIX

Unicode has multiple code blocks where it defines currencies. This module aims to expose a data structure that makes
it more convenient to work with currency characters.
