-- Module      : Data.Char.Currency
-- Description : The module exposes a type that defines the different currencies for which there is a Unicode equivalent.
-- Maintainer  : hapytexeu+gh@gmail.com
-- Stability   : experimental
-- Portability : POSIX
--
-- Unicode has multiple code blocks where it defines currencies. This module aims to expose a data structure that makes
-- it more convenient to work with currency characters.
